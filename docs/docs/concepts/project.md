# Projects

Projects are the way to organize and centralize [resources](./resources.md). Resources are unique per project, and deleting the project will delete all its
resources and related information.

The project's name must be unique, but it can always be changed. You can also add a logo for display purposes, but it is not mandatory.

> Red Kite allows to work on multiple projects at once, but using the global project filter in the navigation bar, you can also focus your work on a single project at a time. It will pre-filter data in displays such as tables and metrics.
