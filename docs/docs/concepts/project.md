# Projects

Projects are the way to organize and centralize resources. Resources are unique per project, and deleting the project will delete all its
resources and related information.

The project's name must be unique, but it can always be changed. You can also add a logo for display purposes, but it is not mandatory.

## Subnets

In the case where a target owns a public subnet, you can add the different subnets in the projects page.

For a subnet of `127.0.0.1/24`, you would simply add `127.0.0.1` in the _IP Address_ field, and the `/24` in the _Short Mask_ field.
