# Topology

<EnterpriseNotice />

The topology view, or graph view, represents the different resources through a graph. It allows for better data visualization to quickly get
the global portrait of an attack surface.

By simply selecting a project, searching a resource and selecting it, you can get a quick overview of its attack surface. Selecting a
resource in the graph will also provide you with an preview of its data.

The graphs are by default generated with a depth of 5, but you can specify the depth that you want.

Graphs can also be generated in a tree format

Other options, like removing the colors and curving the lines, are available through the graph buttons at the top.
