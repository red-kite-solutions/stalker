# Jobs

A job is the way for Red Kite to find new information. It is started by Red Kite and runs in a contained environment. Different jobs will
generate different findings. It is possible to reference a Finding's output variable as a job parameter. A job parameter is one of a job's
input variables.

When referencing a Finding's output variable by name (ex: `${domainName}`), the variable name is case insensitive.

A job can generate multiple findings of one or many finding types.

## Types of Jobs

Multiple types of jobs are supported in Red Kite.

The types of jobs are:

- [Python job](#python-job)
- [Nuclei job](#nuclei-job)

> More information about the implementation of jobs is available in the
> [development section of the documentation.](../development/implementing-jobs)

### Python Job

| Type | Language |
| ---- | -------- |
| Code | Python   |

A python job is the standard way of making a job. It gives you full flexibility, but you have to implement it yourself.

The python jobs come with a built-in SDK to help you properly [output findings and logs](/docs/concepts/findings).

### Nuclei Job

| Type   | Language |
| ------ | -------- |
| Nuclei | Yaml     |

A Nuclei job uses [Project Discovery's Nuclei](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei) to run Nuclei templates and output findings that
Red Kite understands. It comes with a built-in parser, but if it does not suit your needs, you can specify a custom finding handler. This
custom finding handler will be responsible for parsing the Nuclei Findings as well as outputing the Red Kite compatible findings. It is
implemented in python. Don't worry though, a template, a custom class and the python SDK are avalailable to help you.

## Built-in Jobs

Red Kite comes preloaded with a robust selection of built-in jobs directly sourced from our
[official jobs repository](https://github.com/red-kite-solutions/stalker-templates-community).

Built-in jobs are managed by Red Kite and therefore cannot be modified. If you wish to tweak one of our jobs, you may simply duplicate it
and edit the copy. When you are ready, use the copy and disable the original.

### AmassDomainDiscoveryJob

<EnterpriseNotice />

Leverages OWASP's Amass to find domain relationships, subdomains, IP addresses, organizations, etc.

| -------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| domainNames    | string[] | An FQDN array to resolve to IP addresses |
| timeoutMinutes | number   | A timeout for Amass, in minutes          |

**Possible generated findings :**

- HostnameFinding
- HostnameIpFinding
- IpFinding
- AmassDomainReportFinding
- AmassHostReportFinding
- RirOrgFinding

Also, Amass uses the `datasources.yaml` file to store the API keys of several possible data sources. To use this feature in Red Kite's job, you can dynamically provide the `datasources.yaml` values as parameters from [Red Kite secrets](./secrets) by following the proper syntax.

#### Setting a datasource API key for Amass

To set an API key in the `datasources.yaml` content from a Red Kite parameter, simply follow the variable naming convention `s_NAME_path_to_key`, which consits of the prefix `s_`, the targeted datasource name in place of `NAME`, an underscore `_`, and then the full yaml path to the API key to set. The job looks for parameters named that way to dynamically fill the yaml file.

As an example, the API key for the Shodan datasource will be set:

First, [create a secret](./secrets) containing Shodan's API key. Use a meaningful name like `ShodanApiKey`.

Second, use the `ShodanApiKey` secret in a job parameter. To do so, we need to locate where in the `datasources.yaml` file structure the key is located. 

Here is, for reference, part of the `datasources.yaml` file where we want to set the Shodan API key :

```yaml
datasources:
  - name: 360PassiveDNS
    ttl: 3600
    creds:
      account: 
        apikey: null
  # [...]
  - name: Shodan # The targeted datasource name
    ttl: 10080
    creds:
      account: 
        apikey: null # Where we set the API key
  - name: Spamhaus
    ttl: 1440
    creds:
      account: 
        username: null
        password: null
  # [...]
global_options: 
  minimum_ttl: 1440
```

> The full file structure is available on [the repository](https://github.com/owasp-amass/amass/blob/master/examples/datasources.yaml).

Here, to set Shodan's API key, you would have to name your job parameter `s_Shodan_creds_account_apikey` and set the value from the created secret `ShodanApiKey`.

For an ad-hoc job launch, your parameters would therefore look like the following:

```yaml
parameters:
  - name: domainNames
    value:
      - example.com
      - www.example.com
  - name: timeoutMinutes
    value: 120
  - name: s_Shodan_creds_account_apikey # The variable name referencing the location in datasources.yaml
    value: ${ secrets.ShodanApiKey } # The injection of the secret value
```

To include your `ShodanApiKey` secret in the subcription that launches this job (named *Extended discovery for domain names*), include it in its parameters in the same way.
