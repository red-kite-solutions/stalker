# Jobs

A job is the way for Red Kite to find new information. It is started by Red Kite and runs in a contained environment. Different jobs will
generate different findings. It is possible to reference a Finding's output variable as a job parameter. A job parameter is one of a job's
input variables.

When referencing a Finding's output variable by name (ex: `${domainName}`), the variable name is case insensitive.

A job can generate multiple findings of one or many finding types.

## Types of Jobs

Multiple types of jobs are supported in Red Kite.

The types of jobs are:

- [Python job](#python-job)
- [Nuclei job](#nuclei-job)

> More information about the implementation of jobs is available in the
> [development section of the documentation.](../development/implementing-jobs)

### Python Job

| Type | Language |
| ---- | -------- |
| Code | Python   |

A python job is the standard way of making a job. It gives you full flexibility, but you have to implement it yourself.

The python jobs come with a built-in SDK to help you properly [output findings and logs](/docs/concepts/findings).

### Nuclei Job

| Type   | Language |
| ------ | -------- |
| Nuclei | Yaml     |

A Nuclei job uses [Project Discovery's Nuclei](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei) to run Nuclei templates and output findings that
Red Kite understands. It comes with a built-in parser, but if it does not suit your needs, you can specify a custom finding handler. This
custom finding handler will be responsible for parsing the Nuclei Findings as well as outputing the Red Kite compatible findings. It is
implemented in python. Don't worry though, a template, a custom class and the python SDK are avalailable to help you.

To launch a Nuclei job from the launcher, you have to specify the following parameters:

| Name              | Example value    | Identifies a resource | Description                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | :-------------------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| targetIp          | 1.1.1.1          |           x           | The IP address at which the target server is located.                                                                                        |
| port              | 443              |           x           | The port to connect to reach the server.                                                                                                     |
| domainName        | example.com      |           x           | The domain name to target, or, for websites, used to access the virtual host.                                                                |
| path              | /                |           x           | The server path at which the website is located. Used to identify the website.                                                               |
| ssl               | true             |                       | Specifies if the protocol used should be HTTP ou HTTPS                                                                                       |
| endpoint          | /example.php     |                       | Used to target websites at a particular endpoint without changing the targeted website.                                                      |
| stalkerOutputType | domain           |                       | The target resource type to emit findings to. Possible values are "domain", "host", "port" and "website".                                    |
| outputFindingName | MyExampleFinding |                       | Will be the name of the finding when emitted. This is the value that an event subscription would react to in the subscription finding array. |

Targeting a website identified by the IP `1.1.1.1`, the port `443`, the domain `example.com` and the path `/` on the endpoint `/example.txt`
would result in targeting the URL `https://example.com/example.txt`. The IP and path value, in that case, are only used to attach the
findings to the correct website.

The different possible combination of parameters to target different types of resources are the following:

| Resource | Required parameters                   | Optional parameters |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Domain   | domainName                            |                     |
| Host     | targetIp                              |                     |
| Port     | targetIp, port                        |                     |
| Website  | domainName, targetIp, port, path, ssl | endpoint            |

Regardless of the resource type that you are targeting, **if no custom handler is provided**, you require the two following parameters as
well:

| Name              | Example value    | Description                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| stalkerOutputType | domain           | The target resource type to emit findings to. Possible values are "domain", "host", "port" and "website".                                    |
| outputFindingName | MyExampleFinding | Will be the name of the finding when emitted. This is the value that an event subscription would react to in the subscription finding array. |

> If a custom handler is provided, you can omit the `stalkerOutputType` and the `outputFindingName` values.

Here is what it would look like to manually launch the job for a `website` at `https://example.com/`, targeting the endpoint at
`https://example.com/example.txt`, without a custom handler:

```yaml
parameters:
  - name: stalkerOutputType
    value: website
  - name: outputFindingName
    value: MyWebsiteFinding
  - name: targetIp
    value: "1.1.1.1"
  - name: port
    value: 443
  - name: domainName
    value: example.com
  - name: path
    value: "/"
  - name: ssl
    value: true
  - name: endpoint
    value: "/example.txt"
```

## Built-in Jobs

Red Kite comes preloaded with a robust selection of built-in jobs directly sourced from our
[official jobs repository](https://github.com/red-kite-solutions/stalker-templates-community).

Built-in jobs are managed by Red Kite and therefore cannot be modified. If you wish to tweak one of our jobs, you may simply duplicate it
and edit the copy. When you are ready, use the copy and disable the original.

### AmassDomainDiscoveryJob

<EnterpriseNotice />

Leverages OWASP's Amass to find domain relationships, subdomains, IP addresses, organizations, etc.

**Input variables :**

| Variable Name  | Type     | Value Description                        |
| -------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| domainNames    | string[] | An FQDN array to resolve to IP addresses |
| timeoutMinutes | number   | A timeout for Amass, in minutes          |

**Possible generated findings :**

- HostnameFinding
- HostnameIpFinding
- IpFinding
- AmassDomainReportFinding
- AmassHostReportFinding
- RirOrgFinding

Also, Amass uses the `datasources.yaml` file to store the API keys of several possible data sources. To use this feature in Red Kite's job,
you can dynamically provide the `datasources.yaml` values as parameters from [Red Kite secrets](./secrets) by following the proper syntax.

#### Setting a datasource API key for Amass

To set an API key in the `datasources.yaml` content from a Red Kite parameter, simply follow the variable naming convention
`s_NAME_path_to_key`, which consits of the prefix `s_`, the targeted datasource name in place of `NAME`, an underscore `_`, and then the
full yaml path to the API key to set. The job looks for parameters named that way to dynamically fill the yaml file.

As an example, the API key for the Shodan datasource will be set:

First, [create a secret](./secrets) containing Shodan's API key. Use a meaningful name like `ShodanApiKey`.

Second, use the `ShodanApiKey` secret in a job parameter. To do so, we need to locate where in the `datasources.yaml` file structure the key
is located.

Here is, for reference, part of the `datasources.yaml` file where we want to set the Shodan API key :

```yaml
datasources:
  - name: 360PassiveDNS
    ttl: 3600
    creds:
      account:
        apikey: null
  # [...]
  - name: Shodan # The targeted datasource name
    ttl: 10080
    creds:
      account:
        apikey: null # Where we set the API key
  - name: Spamhaus
    ttl: 1440
    creds:
      account:
        username: null
        password: null
  # [...]
global_options:
  minimum_ttl: 1440
```

> The full file structure is available on [the repository](https://github.com/owasp-amass/amass/blob/master/examples/datasources.yaml).

Here, to set Shodan's API key, you would have to name your job parameter `s_Shodan_creds_account_apikey` and set the value from the created
secret `ShodanApiKey`.

For an ad-hoc job launch, your parameters would therefore look like the following:

```yaml
parameters:
  - name: domainNames
    value:
      - example.com
      - www.example.com
  - name: timeoutMinutes
    value: 120
  - name: s_Shodan_creds_account_apikey # The variable name referencing the location in datasources.yaml
    value: ${ secrets.ShodanApiKey } # The injection of the secret value
```

To include your `ShodanApiKey` secret in the subcription that launches this job (named _Extended discovery for domain names_), include it in
its parameters in the same way.
